## Introduction

This Flutter application demonstrates how to create a responsive layout for different device types: **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop**. The layout automatically adjusts based on the screen size using the `LayoutBuilder` widget. A dynamic **navigation bar** is included, with the ability to toggle its visibility.

## Features

- Responsive UI for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Separate navigation bar that can be toggled on and off.
- Clean, modern design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Uses Flutter's built-in `LayoutBuilder` for responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building cross-platform applications.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.
  
## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    gh repo clone ChathuminiBandara/responsive_dashbord_ui    
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd responsive_dashboard_ui
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## How it Works

### Mobile Layout
- Optimized for screens smaller than 500px in width.
- Provides a compact, vertical layout with navigation elements tailored for smaller devices.

### Tablet Layout
- Activates for screen sizes between 500px and 1100px.
- Utilizes the extra space by offering more components on the screen compared to the mobile view.

### Desktop Layout
- Designed for screens wider than 1100px.
- Fully leverages the horizontal space with a sidebar, more detailed navigation, and larger widgets.
